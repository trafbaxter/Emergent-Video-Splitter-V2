# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Invalid requests return 400 status codes with descriptive error messages instead of 500 errors. Tested time-based, interval-based, and invalid JSON scenarios - all handled correctly. âœ… CORS HEADERS MAINTAINED: All endpoints continue to have proper CORS headers after the fixes. âœ… NO 500 ERRORS: Confirmed that the previous 500 errors have been resolved and replaced with appropriate 400/404 status codes. âœ… JSON RESPONSE FORMAT: Video streaming endpoint correctly returns JSON with stream_url instead of redirects.

Fallback to estimation when FFmpeg Lambda unavailable. âœ… VIDEO SPLITTING INTEGRATION: Split-video endpoint properly calls FFmpeg Lambda asynchronously, returns 202 status for processing. Proper validation prevents 500 errors, returns descriptive 400 errors for invalid configurations. âœ… CORS HEADERS MAINTAINED: All CORS headers working correctly with FFmpeg integration across all endpoints. âœ… UPLOAD/STREAMING COMPATIBILITY: Video upload generates proper S3 presigned URLs, streaming returns JSON with stream_url format compatible with FFmpeg processing. âœ… ERROR HANDLING: Proper fallback behavior when FFmpeg Lambda unavailable, graceful degradation to file size estimation. âœ… ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING: Video splitting returns 202 status correctly for async FFmpeg processing.

    message: "CRITICAL FFMPEG LAMBDA INTEGRATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED: After comprehensive testing specifically focused on the user's 11:33 duration issue, I have discovered that FFmpeg Lambda integration is NOT working for metadata extraction. The user's reported duration of 11:33 (693 seconds) EXACTLY matches the file size estimation formula: max(60, int((693MB / 60MB) * 60)) = 693 seconds. This proves the system is falling back to file size estimation instead of calling FFmpeg Lambda for real FFprobe data. While the Lambda architecture appears to be in place and permissions seem fixed (no 500 errors), the actual FFmpeg processing is not being invoked for video-info requests. The user's issue is NOT resolved - they are still seeing estimated duration (11:33) instead of real video duration (10:49). This is a high-priority issue requiring investigation of why FFmpeg Lambda is not being called for metadata extraction."
