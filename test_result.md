# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "CODE IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED: Comprehensive testing confirms subtitle detection logic is correctly implemented. Both ffprobe JSON parsing (codec_type == 'subtitle') and ffmpeg regex patterns work correctly for various formats. The user-reported issue may be environmental: FFmpeg layer missing ffprobe, S3 access issues, Lambda timeouts, or permissions problems. Enhanced logging added for debugging."

        comment: "CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Found root cause - main Lambda was hardcoding 'subtitle_streams': [] instead of using data from FFmpeg Lambda. Enhanced logging revealed FFmpeg Lambda correctly detects subtitles (Found 1 subtitle streams using regex pattern) but main Lambda ignored this. Fixed by properly mapping subtitle_streams count from FFmpeg Lambda response. Both main and FFmpeg Lambda functions deployed. The subtitle detection is now working end-to-end."

    message: "DOWNLOAD FUNCTIONALITY FIX: Successfully identified and fixed the 500 Internal Server Error in the download endpoint. The issue was caused by direct access to pathParameters without null checking, while other functions had been updated with robust error handling. Fixed by updating handle_download function with the same defensive pattern used in other endpoints. Lambda function updated and deployed. Ready for backend testing to verify the download functionality is working correctly."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "DOWNLOAD ENDPOINT FIX SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED: Completed comprehensive testing of the download endpoint fix with 100% success rate. The critical issue has been resolved - fixed incorrect S3 exception handling (s3.exceptions.NoSuchKey â†’ ClientError) which was causing 500 errors to be returned instead of proper 404 responses. All test scenarios now work correctly: valid downloads return 302 redirects with presigned URLs, missing files return 404 with descriptive error messages, malformed requests return 400 errors, and robust path parameter extraction handles various URL formats. CORS headers are properly maintained. The user-reported 500 Internal Server Error when clicking Download button has been completely fixed. Download functionality is now ready for production use."

    message: "Implemented complete video splitting application with FFmpeg integration. All backend endpoints and frontend components are ready for testing. FFmpeg is installed and configured. Need to test video upload, analysis, splitting functionality, and subtitle preservation."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of all backend functionality. All core features are working correctly. There is one minor issue with chapter detection - the ffmpeg-python library doesn't properly extract chapters that are visible when using ffprobe directly. This affects the chapter-based splitting method, but time-based and interval-based splitting work perfectly. All other functionality (upload, processing, progress tracking, download, cleanup) works as expected."

    message: "Tested the large file upload handling improvements. The backend now correctly handles video uploads using a streaming approach with 1MB chunks. All tests passed successfully, including file upload, video info extraction, splitting, and cleanup. Progress tracking works correctly during processing. The backend can now handle large video files without loading the entire file into memory."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of all frontend components. The video upload interface, video preview with timeline control, split configuration interface, and processing progress and results display all work correctly. The UI is responsive and works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile views. The application has a beautiful gradient background and styling as required. All core functionality works as expected, including file selection, video upload, split configuration, processing, and download."

    message: "NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ISSUE RESOLVED: Successfully diagnosed and fixed the network connectivity issue preventing video uploads. The problem was a port mismatch between the backend (running on port 8000) and the Kubernetes ingress configuration (expecting port 8001). Updated supervisor configuration to run backend on port 8001 and confirmed the backend is now accessible via the public URL. All API endpoints are working correctly."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "NETWORK CONNECTIVITY DIAGNOSIS: Identified port mismatch issue. The backend is running on port 8000 (confirmed in supervisor config), but the review request mentioned port 8001. The backend is accessible locally at http://localhost:8000/api/ but returns a 502 Bad Gateway error when accessed via the public URL. CORS is properly configured to allow all origins. The issue appears to be with the Kubernetes ingress or proxy configuration not correctly routing to port 8000. Recommend updating the Kubernetes ingress configuration to route to port 8000 instead of 8001, or updating the supervisor configuration to run the backend on port 8001."

If the frontend is still experiencing network errors, the issue may be on the frontend side or with how it's connecting to the backend."
