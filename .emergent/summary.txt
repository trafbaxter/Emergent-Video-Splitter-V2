The previous AI engineer meticulously resolved critical issues in the Video Splitter Pro application, transitioning it from an initial build to a more stable state. Key challenges included stabilizing AWS Amplify deployment, re-implementing authentication from MongoDB to DynamoDB due to scalability issues, and migrating video processing from a synchronous API Gateway model to an asynchronous SQS-triggered Lambda architecture. The engineer systematically addressed numerous technical blockers: fixing frontend-backend communication for video splitting, debugging supervisor configurations, resolving missing FFmpeg dependencies (), correcting method mapping for splitting types, and establishing robust SQS integration for automated job processing. The process involved deep dives into code, log analysis, and iterative fixes across both frontend and backend components, often confronting unexpected regressions or underlying architectural flaws. The work demonstrates a strong analytical approach to complex distributed system debugging.

<product_requirements>
The Video Splitter Pro application aims to provide robust video splitting for various formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and large files (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Core features include splitting by time/intervals/chapters, video preview, quality preservation, optional compression, and automatic keyframe insertion. The application leverages a React frontend and an AWS Lambda backend, initially with FastAPI and MongoDB, now migrated to DynamoDB. Key requirements included migrating to AWS Amplify, resolving frontend deployment issues, configuring CORS for S3 uploads/downloads using presigned URLs, implementing accurate video metadata extraction via FFmpeg in a Lambda layer, and building a comprehensive user authentication system (signup, login, upload history). The UI is expected to be professional, featuring a gradient background and glass morphism cards.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend UI framework.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for API, FFmpeg, and Auth.
- **AWS S3**: Object storage for videos and job queues.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for users and jobs (migrated from MongoDB).
- **AWS SQS**: Message queue for asynchronous job processing.
- **FFmpeg/FFprobe**: Video processing tools.
- **JWT (PyJWT)**: Token-based authentication.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Presigned URLs**: Secure S3 access.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application features a React frontend and an AWS Lambda/FastAPI backend, integrated with AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and now SQS.



-   ****: The primary AWS Lambda function, handling core API routes (authentication, S3 presigned URL generation, orchestration of video processing).
    -   **Changes**: Initially fixed for CORS, migrated from MongoDB to DynamoDB for user/job data. Modified to send video splitting job details to SQS instead of creating S3 job files.  was updated to prioritize DynamoDB for job status, with a fallback to S3 file counting. The  function's S3 path was corrected from  to .
-   ****: The actual FFmpeg/FFprobe Lambda function, performs video processing.
    -   **Importance**: Responsible for heavy-lifting video processing (metadata extraction, splitting).
    -   **Changes**: Updated to be triggered by SQS events instead of direct invocation. Modified  to parse SQS events. Integrated DynamoDB updates to report job status (processing, completed, failed) and detailed output file metadata (duration, size, s3_key). The  function call signature was corrected to match its definition.
-   ****: Frontend component for video splitting UI.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to extract  from API responses for progress polling. Initial  state was .
-   ****: Script to create DynamoDB tables (, ). Important for database architecture.
-   ****: Script to manually process S3 job queue files. Used for testing before SQS automation.
-   ****: New script to create SQS queue and configure Lambda event source mapping.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected SQS attribute names and Lambda event source mapping configuration details.
-   ****: New script to add SQS permissions to the FFmpeg Lambda's IAM role.
-   ****: New deployment script for the SQS-enabled FFmpeg Lambda.
-   ****: Deployment script for the main Lambda ().
-   ****: Tracks testing outcomes and project status.

<pending_tasks>
- **Inconsistent Progress / Duration Issue**: The job status calculation in the main Lambda leads to progress dropping (e.g., 50% to 30%) and the UI not knowing job completion despite actual video splitting success. Duration metadata for split files still shows 0:00.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the core video splitting functionality with SQS integration was confirmed to be working. The application can now successfully:
1.  Upload videos to S3.
2.  Initiate video splitting, with the main Lambda sending an SQS message.
3.  The FFmpeg Lambda is automatically triggered by SQS, downloads the video, processes it, and uploads split files to S3.
4.  The FFmpeg Lambda now correctly updates job status (including detailed results with file sizes) in DynamoDB.
5.  The previous issues of  missing, method mapping ( vs. ), and the FFmpeg Lambda's function signature mismatch have all been resolved. The frontend is correctly extracting the  and polling for status.

However, the user reported a new issue: the progress bar behaves erratically (e.g., 25% -> 50% -> 30%), and the application UI doesn't recognize job completion, even though video files are successfully split and available in S3. The download button also returned an error, which has been addressed in the backend but needs frontend verification. The most recent diagnosis points to a race condition or inconsistency in the job status calculation within the main Lambda, specifically related to how it determines progress and retrieves detailed results for display, leading to the Status check temporarily unavailable, processing continues message and incorrect duration display (0:00).

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the race condition in the  function of  to ensure consistent progress reporting and accurate display of split video durations.
