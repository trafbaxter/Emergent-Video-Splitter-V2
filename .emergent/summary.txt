The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex migration and feature addition for the Video Splitter Pro application. Initially, critical bugs were resolved, including a persistent 500 Internal Server Error during video download and an inaccurate subtitle detection issue. The download fix involved correcting S3 exception handling in the main Lambda, while subtitle detection required enhancing FFmpeg Lambda's logic and fixing hardcoded empty subtitle arrays in the main Lambda's metadata processing.

Following this, the focus shifted to implementing a robust user authentication system. This proved challenging due to AWS Lambda dependency packaging issues, requiring iterative attempts to correctly bundle Python libraries like , , and  for deployment. Crucially, significant effort was also directed towards addressing sensitive API key exposure, leading to the creation of , , and the removal of hardcoded credentials across various scripts and Lambda functions, though the user still reports lingering secret exposure concerns. The frontend was updated with authentication components and routing, but its full functionality is pending an Amplify redeployment.

<product_requirements>
The Video Splitter Pro application aims to provide a robust solution for splitting video files while preserving subtitles. It must support various video formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and handle large file sizes (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Core functionalities include splitting by time, auto-intervals, or chapters, video preview, quality preservation, optional compression, and automatic keyframe insertion. The initial implementation utilized a FastAPI backend with FFmpeg, a React frontend, and MongoDB for metadata, incorporating streaming uploads. The ongoing development involves migrating the application to AWS Amplify for scalability, which has encompassed resolving frontend deployment issues, configuring CORS, handling S3 uploads/downloads, ensuring accurate video metadata extraction (including duration and subtitles), and integrating real FFmpeg processing via a Lambda layer. Most recently, the core splitting and download functionalities were verified, and the focus has shifted to implementing user authentication with features like signup, login, and upload history.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was focused on implementing Phase 1 of the user authentication system and resolving related deployment and security issues.

The core of the work involved:
1.  **Backend Authentication Implementation**: Integrating authentication logic (user registration, login, email verification, token refresh) directly into the main . This included adding imports for , , and , and creating new handler functions within the existing Lambda.
2.  **Frontend Authentication Components**: Creating new React components under  (, , ) and a  component to separate the main app logic. The main  was updated to include  for routing to these new authentication pages.
3.  **Lambda Dependency Management**: A significant challenge was ensuring Python dependencies (, , ) were correctly packaged and deployed with the Lambda function. Multiple attempts were made, including local installations and custom zip creations (), to ensure these modules were available at runtime. Despite these efforts, testing revealed persistent  errors ( module) in the deployed Lambda environment, resulting in 502 errors from API Gateway.
4.  **Secret Management and Cleanup**: Addressing the user's concern about exposed AWS credentials, the engineer implemented measures to secure sensitive information. This involved creating  and , and modifying various scripts (, , ) and temporary backup files (, , ) to remove hardcoded AWS keys and MongoDB connection strings. The source email address for SES was also converted to an environment variable. While many secrets were removed, the user's latest message indicates that Git still flags secrets.
5.  **Deployment**: The main Lambda function was successfully deployed multiple times to incorporate the authentication logic and dependency packaging attempts. However, the frontend deployment via Amplify has not yet reflected the new React Router-based authentication UI, implying a need for a manual Amplify redeployment (which is outside the agent's direct control).

The current state is that the backend Lambda has the authentication code, but it's not fully functional due to dependency issues. The frontend code for authentication is ready but not visibly live on the Amplify URL, and lingering secret exposure is still reported.
