The previous AI engineer initiated the Video Splitter Pro application, which processes video files using AWS services. The work transitioned from fixing core video splitting issues to building a comprehensive user authentication and management system. Key accomplishments include resolving a race condition in job status reporting, fixing incorrect duration metadata display, and correcting a malformed download URL. Subsequently, the engineer embarked on an extensive authentication enhancement, successfully implementing user roles (User/Admin), a pending approval workflow for new registrations, backend API endpoints for full user management (create, approve, reject, soft delete, change role, reset password), and robust email notifications via AWS SES. The engineer also began implementing Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP), overcoming challenges with Lambda dependency deployment by simplifying the approach. The work involved iterative debugging, particularly with AWS Lambda deployments and dependency management.

<product_requirements>
The Video Splitter Pro application aims to provide robust video splitting for various formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and large files (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Core features include splitting by time/intervals/chapters, video preview, quality preservation, optional compression, and automatic keyframe insertion. The application leverages a React frontend and an AWS Lambda backend, initially with FastAPI and MongoDB, now migrated to DynamoDB. Initial requirements included migrating to AWS Amplify, resolving frontend deployment issues, configuring CORS for S3 uploads/downloads using presigned URLs, implementing accurate video metadata extraction via FFmpeg in a Lambda layer, and building a comprehensive user authentication system (signup, login, upload history). The UI is professional, featuring a gradient background and glass morphism cards.

Recent enhancements require:
1.  **User Roles**: Two types: Users and Admins.
2.  **Admin User Management**: A page for Admins to create, edit, delete users, set passwords, and force password changes on first login.
3.  **User Approval Workflow**: New user signups require admin approval before login. Pop-up alerts and email notifications (signup, approval, rejection) are needed. Login attempts by pending/rejected users should trigger alerts.
4.  **Soft Deletes**: Users should be soft-deleted via a deleted flag in the database. All user retrieval functions must account for this flag.
5.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Required for users.
6.  **Password Reset**: Users must be able to reset their forgotten passwords.
7.  **Email Service**: AWS SES for notifications and TOTP for 2FA.
8.  **Configuration**: Environment variables for critical settings like SES sender email.

<code_architecture>
The application features a React frontend and an AWS Lambda/FastAPI backend, integrated with AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and now SQS.



-   ****: The primary AWS Lambda function, handling core API routes (authentication, S3 presigned URL generation, orchestration of video processing).
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Initially fixed for CORS, migrated from MongoDB to DynamoDB for user/job data.
        -   Modified to send video splitting job details to SQS.
        -    updated to prioritize DynamoDB for job status, with a fallback to S3 file counting. Race condition fixed by ensuring monotonic progress and not hardcoding 30% progress on S3 check failure.
        -    function's S3 path corrected from  to .
        -   Added  for DynamoDB Decimal type JSON serialization in responses.
        -   Integrated comprehensive authentication enhancements: added imports for TOTP and SES, helper functions, updated  function for approval workflow,  for status checks.
        -   Added new admin management endpoints (, ,  for PUT/DELETE) for user listing, approval, creation, soft deletion, role change, and password reset.
        -   Updated  and  to include new routes.
        -   Updated  to use a verified sender email dynamically or from  environment variable.
        -   Added 2FA endpoints: , , , . Simplified TOTP secret generation, offloading QR code generation to frontend.
-   ****: The actual FFmpeg/FFprobe Lambda function, performs video processing.
    -   **Importance**: Responsible for heavy-lifting video processing (metadata extraction, splitting).
    -   **Changes**: Updated to be triggered by SQS events instead of direct invocation. Modified  to parse SQS events. Integrated DynamoDB updates to report job status (processing, completed, failed) and detailed output file metadata (duration, size, s3_key) for each split segment. The  function call signature was corrected.
-   ****: Frontend component for video splitting UI.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to extract  from API responses for progress polling. Initial  state was . Added  state variable to correctly handle download URLs. Updated download function to use  instead of the original S3 key for generating download requests. Adjusted reset function to clear .
-   ****: Script to create DynamoDB tables (, ).
-   ****: Script to manually process S3 job queue files (used for testing before SQS automation).
-   ****: New script to create SQS queue and configure Lambda event source mapping. Corrected SQS attribute names and Lambda event source mapping configuration details.
-   ****: New script to add SQS permissions to the FFmpeg Lambda's IAM role.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the focus was on implementing the Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) feature. The backend implementation of 2FA is complete and fully functional:

1.  **Backend 2FA Endpoints**: New API endpoints have been added to  for 2FA setup (), verification (), disabling (), and for admin management of user 2FA status ().
2.  **TOTP Library Integration**: Challenges with deploying Python TOTP libraries (, ) to AWS Lambda were encountered. Initially, attempts to package  and  directly led to 2FA libraries not available errors. This was resolved by simplifying the approach: only  is now packaged with the Lambda function (reducing package size significantly from 3.9MB to 45KB), and QR code generation for the provisioning URI will be handled on the frontend using JavaScript libraries, which is more secure and efficient.
3.  **Backend Testing**: Extensive backend testing confirmed that the 2FA setup endpoint successfully generates TOTP secrets and provisioning URIs, and the verification endpoint correctly validates TOTP codes.

Currently, the work has transitioned to the **frontend implementation of 2FA**. The following new React components have been created:
-   : Intended to display the TOTP secret and QR code for user setup.
-   : Likely to be the central place for users to manage their 2FA settings and other profile information.

The very last action taken was about to install the QR code generation library for the frontend.
