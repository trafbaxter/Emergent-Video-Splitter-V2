The previous AI engineer focused on stabilizing the Video Splitter Pro application post-initial build, addressing critical deployment, authentication, and video processing issues. Initial challenges involved AWS Amplify deployment failures due to  scanning and subsequent frontend simplification. Authentication was re-implemented, migrating from local setup to AWS Lambda with EC2 MongoDB, then further to DynamoDB to enhance reliability and scalability, resolving persistent CORS and timeout issues. A major architectural pivot occurred due to API Gateway's 29-second timeout, necessitating asynchronous video processing. This led to multiple iterations on video preview (black screen, S3 key path, URL encoding) and video splitting (stuck progress, actual FFmpeg invocation). The engineer struggled with effectively triggering FFmpeg Lambda and getting real-time progress, often leading to regressions or simulated progress. The most recent significant work involved a complete migration from MongoDB to DynamoDB for user and job data, including fixing IAM permissions and VPC configuration issues. The current state is that the video preview works, but video splitting is still non-functional, with the progress bar stuck at 25%, indicating no actual split request is being made.

<product_requirements>
The Video Splitter Pro application aims to provide robust video splitting functionality for various formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and large file sizes (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Core features include splitting by time/intervals/chapters, video preview, quality preservation, optional compression, and automatic keyframe insertion. The application leverages a React frontend and an AWS Lambda backend, initially with FastAPI and MongoDB, now migrated to DynamoDB. Key requirements included migrating to AWS Amplify, resolving frontend deployment issues, configuring CORS for S3 uploads/downloads using presigned URLs, implementing accurate video metadata extraction via FFmpeg in a Lambda layer, and building a comprehensive user authentication system (signup, login, upload history). The UI is expected to be professional, featuring a gradient background and glass morphism cards.

<code_architecture>
The application features a React frontend and an AWS Lambda/FastAPI backend, integrated with AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB.



-   ****: The primary AWS Lambda function, handling core API routes, authentication, S3 presigned URL generation, and orchestration of video processing.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for CORS (e.g., ), implementing immediate returns for , , and  to avoid API Gateway timeouts. Video streaming now returns  and . MongoDB integration replaced with DynamoDB for user management and job tracking ( and  tables). It now writes job details to S3 () for asynchronous processing.
-   ****: The actual FFmpeg/FFprobe Lambda function (original  was likely outdated).
    -   **Importance**: Performs heavy-lifting video processing (metadata extraction, splitting). Designed to be invoked asynchronously, outputs to  in S3.
    -   **Changes**: Lambda timeout increased from 10 minutes to 15 minutes, memory increased to 3GB to handle large video files.
-   ****: Frontend component for video splitting UI.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to handle file uploads, integrate , fix  propagation. Refactored video preview to use direct DOM manipulation () for MKV playback, corrected S3 key path handling, and added . Last major change was an attempt to revert to direct S3 keys with proper URL encoding, but the split button is currently not making the request.
-   **, , **: Frontend components for authentication.
    -   **Importance**: Client-side interface and state for user signup/login.
    -   **Changes**: Created/restored to re-integrate authentication features, now interacting with DynamoDB backend.
-   ****: Script to create DynamoDB tables (, ).
    -   **Importance**: Essential for the new database architecture.
    -   **Changes**: Created to define table schemas, including  for .
-   ****: Script to manually process S3 job queue files.
    -   **Importance**: Used for testing the background processing flow, reading job files from S3 and invoking the FFmpeg Lambda.
    -   **Changes**: Created to facilitate testing of the S3-based job queue system.
-   ** / **: Scripts to configure CORS for the S3 bucket.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for direct frontend uploads/downloads to S3.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use correct S3 bucket name and broad CORS rules (), specifically enhanced for video streaming ( header).
-   ****: Tracks testing outcomes and project status.
    -   **Changes**: Constantly updated to reflect resolved issues (CORS, timeouts, video preview, S3 key paths, MongoDB to DynamoDB migration) and identify new regressions or outstanding problems.

The current architecture involves a React frontend interacting with the main Lambda (via API Gateway). The main Lambda handles authentication (DynamoDB), S3 presigned URL generation, and creates job files in S3 (). The FFmpeg Lambda is intended to be triggered by S3 event notifications (or explicit invocation from  for testing) to process these job files and output results to  in S3. Job status is tracked by counting files in the  S3 prefix.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Split Request Fix**: The primary issue is that the Split Video button in the frontend is not making the API request.
-   **Actual Video Processing Trigger**: Ensure the FFmpeg Lambda is automatically triggered and processes videos based on the S3 job queue.
-   **Job Status Polling**: Refine frontend polling of job status to display real-time progress and completion.
-   **User Authentication Enhancements**: Implement remaining features like 2FA, password policies, and email verification.
-   **Upload History**: Integrate upload history tracking using DynamoDB.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed a significant migration of the database from EC2-hosted MongoDB to AWS DynamoDB. This involved creating new DynamoDB tables (, ), updating the  to use DynamoDB for all user authentication and job-related operations, and resolving infrastructure issues such as Lambda VPC configuration causing 504 timeouts and missing IAM permissions for DynamoDB access. The engineer successfully verified that user registration and login are now fully functional with DynamoDB and that the Lambda function is responsive.

Despite these successes, the user reported that video splitting is *still* getting stuck at 25%, and no entries are appearing in the DynamoDB Jobs table. The engineer's immediate investigation by analyzing the console logs revealed a critical finding: the frontend is **not making the video splitting API request** when the Split Video button is clicked. The 25% progress observed by the user is merely a default placeholder, indicating no active job is being tracked, rather than actual processing. The last action before this summary was the AI engineer identifying this root cause.
