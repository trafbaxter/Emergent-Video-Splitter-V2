The AI engineer's work involved two major phases: first, stabilizing and debugging a video splitting application for local Windows 11 compatibility, resolving network (CORS, port mismatches), environment variable, and FFmpeg issues. This phase culminated in a fully functional local setup. The second, ongoing phase, is a significant infrastructure migration to AWS Amplify. This involves configuring AWS CLI/Amplify CLI, setting up S3 for storage, migrating the FastAPI backend to AWS Lambda, and configuring the React frontend for Amplify hosting. The current challenge focuses on debugging the  build process for the frontend, addressing issues like incorrect build commands, directory structures, missing dependencies (), and  resolution for React 18/19 compatibility in the Amplify build environment. The engineer is providing step-by-step  and environment variable fixes.

<product_requirements>
The application, Video Splitter Pro, is designed to split video files, retaining subtitles, with features including splitting by time points, automatic intervals, or chapters. It must support diverse video formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and handle large file sizes (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Key requirements include a video preview feature, quality preservation, optional compression adjustment, and automatic keyframe insertion at split points for clean segments. The initial AI engineer successfully implemented these core functionalities using a FastAPI backend with FFmpeg for processing, a React frontend for the user interface, and MongoDB for storing job and metadata, incorporating streaming uploads for large files. The current objective is to migrate this fully functional application to AWS Amplify for scalability and cloud readiness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively assisting the user with the AWS Amplify migration and resolving deployment issues. The core application had been successfully set up on the user's local Windows 11 machine, confirming all video splitting features. The current focus shifted to deploying this application to AWS Amplify.

The engineer successfully:
1.  Obtained AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region) and confirmed MongoDB Atlas as the preferred database.
2.  Installed AWS CLI and configured credentials.
3.  Installed AWS Amplify CLI.
4.  Created necessary AWS infrastructure components programmatically, including an IAM role (), an S3 bucket (), and a Lambda function for the FastAPI backend.
5.  Created new files for AWS deployment: , , , , and .
6.  Resolved initial deployment script errors ( command not found).
7.  Fixed API Gateway routing issues by adding  method and correct Lambda integration.
8.  Confirmed the AWS Lambda backend was working correctly via direct invocation.
9.  Updated Node.js to v24.3.0 and npm to v11.4.2, restarting the frontend service and verifying compatibility.

The current work is centered on debugging the  file for frontend deployment to AWS Amplify. The user has encountered a series of build errors:
*   Initially,  was used instead of yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command., and  was incorrect.
*   Then,  occurred, indicating only the frontend folder was uploaded.
*   Next,  appeared, suggesting  was not installed or resolved properly.
*   Most recently, the error is , followed by .

The engineer has proposed several solutions for  including:
1.  Adding  and  to Amplify Environment Variables.
2.  Forcing React 19 installation using 
added 3 packages in 5s.
3.  Downgrading to React 18 using 
added 2 packages, changed 3 packages, and audited 6 packages in 3s

found 0 vulnerabilities (recommended as most reliable).
4.  Patching  to use legacy React import style.

The immediate next step is for the user to try one of these solutions.
