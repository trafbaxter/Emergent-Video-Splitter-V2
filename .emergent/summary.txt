The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around stabilizing and debugging a full-stack video splitting application, transitioning it from an initial Kubernetes container environment to a fully functional local Windows 11 setup for the user. The initial phase involved persistent network connectivity issues between the React frontend and FastAPI backend, manifesting as CORS errors, 404s, and connection refused errors. Key debugging efforts included meticulously identifying and correcting backend port mismatches (8000 vs. 8001), troubleshooting environment variable loading in both frontend and backend, resolving internal FastAPI route conflicts (duplicate upload endpoint), and ensuring FFmpeg was correctly installed and accessible for video processing. The engineer iterated through various solutions, including React proxy configurations and direct external URL usage, before successfully transitioning to and setting up the entire application on the user's local Windows machine, confirming full functionality of all core features.

<product_requirements>
The application is designed to split video files while retaining subtitles. Key functionalities requested include splitting by time points, automatic intervals, or chapters. It must support various video formats (prioritizing MKV and MP4, with support for AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM), handle large file sizes (300 MB to 1.5 GB and beyond), and offer a video preview feature. Quality preservation and the option to adjust compression are required. Additionally, the system should automatically insert keyframes at split points for clean segments. The previous AI engineer implemented these features, leveraging a FastAPI backend with FFmpeg for processing, a React frontend for UI, and MongoDB for job/metadata storage, including streaming uploads for large files.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application defining API endpoints for video upload, splitting, job status, streaming, and cleanup, integrating FFmpeg and MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial fixes included pathing for Windows temp directories, health checks, and streaming enhancements (Range header, CORS, GIF, HEAD). Debug-related changes involved adding  and , removing extensive debug logging, and fixing syntax errors. Critically, a duplicate  endpoint causing mock responses was removed. FFmpeg/ffprobe installation issues were addressed by ensuring it's available. CORS middleware placement was corrected. A new  endpoint was added to allow downloading the entire source code as a zip. Finally, environment variable loading was made more robust with  for  and .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component managing UI state for file uploads, progress, video info, and split configuration, interacting with the backend via Axios.
    -   **Changes Made**: Early fixes included  corruption and MKV file selection. Video preview logic was updated. UI controls for keyframes were added. Debug elements and console logs were added then removed.  null issue was fixed with /. JSX syntax errors were fixed.  was implemented to clear stale state. The  usage was repeatedly modified, shifting between direct external URL, proxy-based local calls, and finally settling on local calls (e.g., ) when using a proxy, then reverting to external URL, and for local Windows setup, using .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores  for backend API access.
    -   **Changes Made**: Iterated multiple times between , , a container IP (), a remote / URL, and an empty string (for proxy).  was added then removed. This file was frequently modified in attempts to establish frontend-backend connectivity. For the Windows local setup, it was configured to .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores  and  for backend database access.
    -   **Changes Made**: Primarily initialized with  and . The content remained consistent ( and /).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Configures Supervisor to manage backend and frontend processes, including their binding ports.
    -   **Changes Made**: The backend port was repeatedly toggled between  and  in an extensive effort to align with Kubernetes ingress rules and resolve network access issues. It was ultimately confirmed to need port .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: (Added and then removed for cloud setup) This file was intended to proxy React development server API calls to the backend, avoiding CORS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Introduced with , modified to proxy  (instead of ), updated to target , then completely removed in favor of direct external URL configuration during cloud debugging. It was not recreated for the final Windows local setup.
-   ** (new)**, ** (new)**, ** (new)**, ** (new)**, ** (new)**:
    -   **Summary**: These files were created specifically to facilitate the local setup and execution of the application on a Windows 11 machine, providing batch scripts and Windows-specific environment variable templates.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files were created as part of the transition to local Windows setup, detailing installation prerequisites, file structures, and startup commands for the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully guided the user through setting up the entire Video Splitter Pro application on their local Windows 11 machine. This involved providing detailed instructions for installing prerequisites (Python, Node.js, MongoDB, FFmpeg) and the application source code.

The core challenge tackled and resolved in this final phase was enabling the application to run outside the Kubernetes container environment. This required:
1.  **Frontend Configuration**: Ensuring  correctly pointed  to . This fixed the  network errors observed earlier.
2.  **Backend Execution**: Providing correct instructions for starting the FastAPI backend on Windows using  after Python virtual environment setup and  installation.
3.  **MongoDB Setup**: Guiding the user on setting up MongoDB locally, and adapting the backend's  to gracefully handle  and  environment variables, including a default fallback.

As a result, the user successfully uploaded a video (), which was processed, split into two parts, and made available for download. All core features (upload, analysis, splitting, quality preservation, keyframes, subtitles, and multiple format support) are now fully functional on the user's local Windows 11 machine.
