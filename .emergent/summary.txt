The AI engineer's work progressed from stabilizing a video splitting application for local Windows 11 to a complex migration onto AWS Amplify. The initial phase successfully ensured local functionality, including video splitting, streaming, and large file uploads. The subsequent and main phase focused on AWS Amplify deployment, encountering significant challenges. These included resolving  build issues (React version compatibility,  conflicts, incorrect directory structures, yarn install v1.22.22

Done in 3.50s. registry errors), fixing CORS configurations for both API Gateway and S3, and debugging the S3 presigned URL upload mechanism. Finally, post-upload, metadata extraction and video streaming were fixed within the Lambda function. The current state is that core video splitting functionality is deployed and works, but a new build error related to Yarn registry was encountered and is being addressed.

<product_requirements>
The Video Splitter Pro application aims to efficiently split video files while preserving subtitles. It must support diverse formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and handle large files (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Key features include splitting by time, auto-intervals, or chapters, video preview, quality preservation, optional compression, and automatic keyframe insertion for clean cuts. The initial AI engineer successfully built these core functionalities using a FastAPI backend with FFmpeg, a React frontend, and MongoDB for metadata, incorporating streaming uploads. The current objective is the ongoing migration of this functional application to AWS Amplify for enhanced scalability and cloud readiness, having recently resolved issues related to frontend deployment, CORS, S3 uploads, and video metadata/streaming.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. The architecture has undergone significant changes due to migration to AWS Amplify.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application, handles video processing, health checks, and API endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**: Robust environment variable loading (, ), CORS middleware adjustments, and a  endpoint. Main processing logic adapted for local Windows environment and later for AWS Lambda backend through .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing UI state for file uploads and interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive modifications for  usage (direct, proxy, localhost),  fix, MKV selection, video preview, keyframe controls. Crucially updated to use S3 presigned POST/PUT for uploads and to fetch video metadata from the new  endpoint.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores  (formerly ) for frontend's API access, and S3 bucket details.
    -   **Changes Made**: Renamed and configured for AWS API Gateway URL and S3 bucket details. Moved to  root after frontend directory restructure.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: New file created to provide environment variables specifically for the Amplify production build, optimizing it.
    -   **Changes Made**: Set , , , , and .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Python Lambda function acting as the FastAPI backend on AWS. Handles API Gateway events, S3 interactions, and video metadata/streaming.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented CORS handling for  requests, updated  to the Amplify domain. Enhanced  for S3 presigned POST/PUT with proper content types and error handling. Fixed  path logic to correctly find videos in S3. Added  (basic analysis) and a new  endpoint.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Defines the AWS Amplify build and deployment process for the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Iteratively fixed: initially for

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively debugging a persistent build failure in AWS Amplify, specifically on the frontend. The core application had been successfully migrated and deployed to AWS Amplify, and subsequent post-deployment issues like CORS (both API Gateway and S3) and S3 presigned URL upload failures were resolved. Additionally, the engineer fixed issues where uploaded videos showed incorrect metadata and video preview was not working, by enhancing the  to correctly extract basic video metadata and stream from S3, and updating  to fetch this information.
