The previous AI engineer meticulously progressed from a locally functional video splitting application to a robust AWS Amplify deployment. The journey began by resolving a critical Yarn registry build error, successfully migrating the frontend to npm, and validating core backend functionality. Subsequently, significant effort was invested in debugging and fixing issues related to video metadata extraction (duration showing 0:00), video preview, and missing UI configuration options, which involved substantial modifications to both Lambda functions and the React frontend.

A major challenge emerged with persistent dependency conflicts during the Amplify build ( and ), leading to a strategic decision to migrate the entire frontend build system from Create React App to Vite, which successfully resolved the build failures. The focus then shifted to integrating a real FFmpeg Lambda layer, overcoming numerous hurdles including Lambda invocation permissions,  availability (implementing  fallback), API Gateway timeouts, and intricate CORS headers. Finally, the splitting functionality was made fully operational, which required fixing path parameter extraction in Lambda and, critically, correcting the frontend logic to properly send all necessary time points for multi-segment video splitting. The work is currently paused at addressing a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to download split video files.

<product_requirements>
The Video Splitter Pro application enables users to efficiently split video files while preserving subtitles. It must support diverse video formats (MKV, MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM) and handle large files (300 MB to 1.5 GB+). Key features include splitting by time, auto-intervals, or chapters, video preview, quality preservation, optional compression, and automatic keyframe insertion. The initial core functionalities were built using a FastAPI backend with FFmpeg, a React frontend, and MongoDB for metadata, incorporating streaming uploads. The ongoing objective is the migration to AWS Amplify for scalability, which has involved resolving frontend deployment issues, CORS configurations, S3 uploads, and ensuring accurate video metadata and streaming. Real FFmpeg processing for metadata extraction and splitting has been successfully integrated via a Lambda layer.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer successfully resolved the issue where video splitting only generated part 1 and the progress bar was stuck at 50%. It was determined that the backend FFmpeg Lambda was working correctly and could produce all segments when given the proper time points. The root cause was identified as a frontend logic error where  was sending an incomplete  array (e.g., ) instead of including the total video duration as the final time point (e.g., ) for time-based splits.

The fix involved modifying the  function in  to dynamically add  to the  array, ensuring that the backend receives the necessary information to create all segments. After this fix and a frontend restart, the user confirmed that The split worked! However, a new issue immediately arose: clicking the Download button for the newly split video parts now results in a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating a problem with the download endpoint. The current work focuses on investigating and resolving this download functionality error.
