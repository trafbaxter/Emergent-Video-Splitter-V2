# Lambda Compatibility Changes

## Overview
Modified `/app/lambda_function.py` to handle Lambda environments where certain libraries (jwt, bcrypt, pymongo) may not be available.

## Changes Made

### 1. Import Section Modifications
- Moved logger initialization before import attempts
- Wrapped problematic imports in try-catch blocks
- Added availability flags: `JWT_AVAILABLE`, `BCRYPT_AVAILABLE`, `MONGODB_AVAILABLE`
- Added warning logs when libraries are not available

### 2. Function Updates

#### JWT-related Functions
- `validate_jwt_from_context()`: Returns None when JWT is not available
- `generate_access_token()`: Returns None when JWT is not available  
- `generate_refresh_token()`: Returns None when JWT is not available
- JWT decode operations: Return 500 error when JWT is not available

#### bcrypt-related Functions
- Password hashing operations: Return 500 error when bcrypt is not available
- Password verification operations: Return 500 error when bcrypt is not available

#### MongoDB-related Functions
- `get_mongo_client()`: Returns None when pymongo is not available
- All database operations gracefully handle None client responses

### 3. Error Handling
- Authentication endpoints return meaningful error messages instead of crashing
- 500 status codes with "Authentication system temporarily unavailable" messages
- Proper logging of missing library warnings

## Testing
- Created compatibility test that simulates Lambda environment without libraries
- Verified that all functions handle missing libraries gracefully
- Confirmed that authentication endpoints return appropriate error responses

## Benefits
1. **No Runtime Crashes**: Code no longer fails with undefined name errors
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Authentication features are disabled rather than breaking the entire application
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Users receive informative error messages about system availability
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Code still works normally when all libraries are available
5. **Lambda Ready**: Can be deployed to Lambda environments with missing dependencies

## Deployment Notes
- In production Lambda environments, ensure required libraries are included in deployment package
- Monitor logs for library availability warnings
- Consider implementing alternative authentication methods for environments without these libraries
